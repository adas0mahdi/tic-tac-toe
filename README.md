# Tic-Tac-Toe



## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking their respective symbols ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell in the grid. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid is fully occupied without any winner, the game ends in a draw.

This repository contains an implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript. It provides a simple and interactive command-line interface to play the game.
